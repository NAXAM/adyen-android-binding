# Adyen Android - Xamarin Android Binding Library

Plz download original native libraries from [here](https://bintray.com/adyen/adyen)

We will need to bind 4 libraries
- Core
- Utils
- CardScan
- UI

In [the original source code](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-android/releases/tag/1.7.1), there are a library for using Android Pay, we also create binding for it, to finish all functionalities in the sample apps.
